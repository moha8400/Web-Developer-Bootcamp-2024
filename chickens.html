    <p><b>The chicken </b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red
        junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
        others are kept as pets or for cockfighting. </p>

    <p>Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There
        are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature. </p>
